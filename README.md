In this project I analyzed the data of a delivery company, which collected GPS data from driver devices. The purpose was to develop a method to predict expected delivery time.

In file groceries_delivery_analysis I conducted an exploration and analysis of data including extensive data preparation and visualization.

In file groceries_delivery_research I tested the accuracy of a simple prediction model based on calculating mean for all data. 
Then I assessed the viability of sector and driver-based delivery time predictions.        -
